## 🚀 Key Features

### 🗂 Excel Integration

- Supports multiple sheets with a quick selector  

### 💡 Adaptive Validation
- Auto-detects column types via headers (`Date`, `Email`, `Amount`, etc.)
- Built-in numeric formatting:

- Inline validation feedback (color-coded + per-field message)
- Header-based **duplicate control**:
  - Choose between **None / Warn / Strict**

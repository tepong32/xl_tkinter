NOTE:
	- Special thanks to this repo for the theme: https://github.com/rdbende/Forest-ttk-theme
	- Tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m4uDS_nyCk
	- tkinter on some python versions is not working unless you install the specific version of tkinter to match your installed/default python version (in my case: "sudo apt-get install python3.11-tk")
	- this contains the basic widgets useful for excel file manipulation. I tried to add line comments as often as needed.
	- added a basic item highlighter when you select an item on the displayed list. Refer to https://pythonprogramming.altervista.org/tkinter-examples-binding-keys/ for other useful examples
